# RCSwitchGateway
## Description
This program uses a modified version of the [rc-switch library](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch) to control 433 MHZ based switches using MQTT commands over Wifi. It runs on [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) microcontrollers. (Currently only tested with Adafruit Huzzah32) This program can also detect 433 MHZ signals and send them back via MQTT. Currently it only supports sending **Type A** signals and can also receive commands from e.g. Kï¿½nig SAS-SA200 and SAS-SA2002 smoke detectors. Please look at the [RC Switch Wiki](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/wiki/Add_New_Remote_Part_1) on how to implement more signals.
## Installation
- This Project uses PlatformIO. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) addon.
- After the image is uploaded to the ESP32 it can be configured using a web interface. If no WLAN is configured the device will automatically start a Wlan access point and a web interface. If a WLAN is already configured press the reset button within 10 seconds after powering up the device to start the web interface. After connecting to the access point the web interface should open automatically. If not open the link http://192.168.4.1 in any web browser. In the web interface the MQTT server and the hostname can also be configured.
## Hardware
In the **Eagle** folder you can find Eagle and Gerber files for a feather board to connect a MX-05V receiver and an FS1000A sender to the Adafruit Huzzah32.
## MQTT commands and events
### Commands
Commands are sent as json text.  
**/hostname/sender/sendtypea**: Command to send a type A RC Signal with the following settings:
`{"group": "11111", "device": "11111", "repeatTransmit": 5, "switchOnOff": true}`
**/hostname/sender/send**: Command to send a custom signal with the following attributes:
`{"code": 1234, "codeLength": 24, "protocol": 1, "repeatTransmit": 5 }`
### Events
Events are just plain numbers.  
**/hostname/queue/length**: Length of the current queue of signals to be sent.  
**/hostname/events/codereceived**: Received code event
